# [ReactPy](https://reactpy.dev/docs/index.html) Template

> ReactPy is a library for building user interfaces in Python without Javascript. ReactPy interfaces are made from components which look and behave similarly to those found in ReactJS. Designed with simplicity in mind, ReactPy can be used by those without web development experience while also being powerful enough to grow with your ambitions.

## What this template includes

* A ReactPy web app, using Flask
* A couple components to get you started
    * A Heading, containing an empty div which gets updated by a script added later in the file
    * A click counter, using `use_state`
    * An event debugger, to help you understand how ReactPy works
* An example of a web app using the above components
* An example of how to include a script (using [dupl analytics](https://analytics.marcusj.tech))
